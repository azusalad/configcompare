# Config Compare
Compares two configs for Valve Source games.
For example if your two input configs are:

![Example inputs](inputexample.png)

Then the output would be

![Example outputs](outputexample.png)

## Usage

Edit config.py first with the locations of the config files you want to compare, and words to ignore.  Then run the program.

`python main.py`
